			<h3>Steps</h3>
				<ol>
				<li> Slice the plantains crosswise into about five pieces, then place in a saucepan and cover with water. Simmer gently until tender, about 15–20 minutes.</li>	
				<li> Drain and let the plantains cool enough to handle, then peel and mash well (or purée in a food processor or blender).</li>
				<li> With a wooden spoon, stir cornmeal, plantains, salt, anise seed, sugar, and finely grated cheese until the mixture resembles dough. Slowly add water, a couple of tablespoons at a time, until the mixture comes together.</li>
				<li>The dough should be soft and kneadable, but not sticky. Let dough rest for ten minutes.</li>
				<li>Heat several inches of oil to 350&deg;. Divide the dough into 16 pieces and roll each one into a smooth ball. (If the dough is too wet and sticky, add more cornmeal.)</li>
				<li> Take each ball and roll it into a log shape with the palms of your hands. Then, continue rolling on a countertop until the dough cylinder is 6-7 inches long. Bring the ends together and overlap them to form a tear-shaped loop, then press the ends together. Repeat this process with the remaining pieces of dough.</li>
				<li> Fry loops of dough in oil until dark golden brown, turning once.</li>
				<li> Serve mandocas warm, with slices of queso fresco and/or butter.</li>
				</ol>
